<p>This sample demonstrates how a custom palette and appearance selector for XtraCharts can be implemented.</p><p>For this, we create two user controls and embed them into the application's form.</p><p><strong>Note: In version 2012 vol </strong><strong>1</strong><strong>, we have introduced a chart Ribbon and toolbar that allow you to quickly customize a chart.</strong></p><p><strong>To start using these tools, locate the corresponding ChartControl's smart tag on your form. For more information, review </strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JHOgsOwGl8"><strong><u>this video</u></strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><br />
